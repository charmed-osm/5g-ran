> As all the charms and the bundle will be in the charm store, you do not need all this.
> Add two folders ready to be uploaded to osm:
 - nsd
 - vnfd <-- in the juju-bundle, point to the charm store

> ^ the package.sh can be put as clear, simple, and complete instructions here in the readme. Remove the package.sh then.

> In the readme, add the commands needed to upload the packages: osm nfpkg-create, and nspkg-create.

> Also add the steps to onboard it to OSM.

> Add an integration part in the end, saying how would you integrate it in OSM with core.

> Cross-model relations are not supported yet in OSM, so add the manual instructions to set up the cross-model relations
