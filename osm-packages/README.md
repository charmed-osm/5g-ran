# Create and Onboard 5g-ran osm packages

> To create osm vnf and ns packages, use the following commands which will
> generate a vnf package structure named ran_vnf and ns package structure named
> ran_ns

```bash
osm package-create vnf ran
osm package-create ns ran
```

> Copy the desriptor into corresponding directory

```bash
cp ran_vnfd.yaml ran_vnf/
cp ran_nsd.yaml ran_ns/
```

Note: Inorder to attach to 5g-core, ensure to change amf-ip, db-ip, upf-ip under
day1 action(config-gnb) section of ran_vnfd.yaml.
These are the external loadbalancer ips of amf,upf and mongodb service
running in 5g-core.

> To place the bundles in vnf package

```bash
mkdir -p "ran_vnf/juju-bundles" && cp ../bundle/bundle.yaml "ran_vnf/juju-bundles"
```

> To onboard packages into OSM, use the following commands

```bash
osm nfpkg-create ran_vnf
osm nspkg-create ran_ns
```

> Onboarded packages can be verified with the following commands

```bash
osm nfpkg-list
osm nspkg-list
```

# Adding vim-account and k8scluster to OSM

## Vim-Account

```bash
osm vim-create --name <vim_name> --user <username> --password <password>
 --auth_url <openstack-url> --tenant <tenant_name> --account_type openstack
```

vim-create command helps to add vim to OSM where,

- "vim_name" is the name of the vim being created.

- "username"and "password" are the credentials of Openstack.

- "tenant_name" is the tenant to be associated to the user in the Openstack.

- "openstack-url" is the URL of Openstack which will be used as VIM

## K8sCluster

```bash
osm k8scluster-add --creds <kube.yaml> --version '1.19' --vim <vim_name>
 --description "RAN Cluster"
 --k8s-nets '{"net1": "<network-name>"}' <cluster_name>
```

K8scluster add helps to attach a cluster with OSM which will be used for
knf deployment.
where

-"kube.yaml" is the configuration of microk8s cluster obtained from
"microk8s config>kube.yaml".

-"vim_name" is the vim created in the last setup.

-"cluster_name" a unique name to identify your cluster.

Note:[Prerequisites and microk8s setup for 5g-core](../README.md)

# Launching the 5g-ran

```bash
osm ns-create --ns_name ran --nsd_name ran_nsd --vim_account <vim_name>
```

> ns-create will instantiate the 5g-ran network service use
> "vim_name" thats added to osm.

## Verifying the services

```bash
osm ns-list
```

> Will display the ns-created with ns-id, with status active and configured
> which means the service is up along with its day1 operations.

```bash
osm ns-show
```

> Will show detailed information of the network service.

```bash
microk8s kubectl get all â€“n ran-kdu-<ns-id>
```

> will dispaly 2 components deployed from bundle in vnfd.

## 5g-ran day2 operation

```bash
osm ns-action ran --vnf_name 1 --kdu_name ran-kdu --action_name config-ue
 --params '{application-name: ran,msin: "00007487",mcc: 208,mnc: 93,
routing-indicator: "0fff",k: 5463,opc: 451011,ue-mgmt-ip: "10.1.135.52",
pdu-session-id: 1,data-network-name: internet,
ue-pdu-macaddress: "8e:14:95:4b:b0:29",sst: 1,sd: "010203",
protection-scheme : "" }'
```

where
. "ran" refers to the network service name,"1" points to vnf member index and
"ran-kdu" is the kdu name used in package.

. Parameters values to be used are as follows,
msin: "00007487", should match digits of imsi number 20893*00007487* added in core.
mcc: 208, should match the digits of imsi number *208*9300007487 added in core.
mnc: 93, should match the digits of imsi number 208*93*00007487 added in
core.ue-mgmt-ip: "10.1.135.5", ue managemet ip is UE pod's eth0 interface ip.
ue-pdu-macaddress: "8e:14:95:4b:b0:29", ue pod's eth1 interface mac address
